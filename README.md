# Astro Git View

A server-side generated source code explorer for git-repositories, inspired by [stagit](https://codemadness.org/stagit.html), built with [Astro](https://astro.build)

See [astro-git](./integrations/astro-git) and [astro-lunr](./integrations/astro-lunr) for the astro-plugins that supply most of the functionality.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
